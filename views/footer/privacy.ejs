            <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

            <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use this website — built as a part of Aman’s college project (with slightly too much attention to detail and a not-so-healthy obsession with good UI).</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>1. Information Collection:</strong>
                    We collect basic information you provide, such as your name, email address, and any other data you voluntarily submit. No, we don’t stalk — unless you're Sakshi, who once said this site was "actually decent" (a high compliment, coming from her).
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>2. How We Use Your Data:</strong>
                    Your data is used to improve user experience, process listings (if that’s a thing here), and occasionally wonder if anyone ever actually reads this section. But we promise not to misuse your information — pinky swear.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>3. Cookies:</strong>
                    This site may use cookies to enhance performance and personalization. Unfortunately, not the chocolate chip kind. You can disable them in your browser if you’re not into digital crumbs.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>4. Data Sharing:</strong>
                    We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties unless legally required or if it’s absolutely necessary to keep the site functioning (and Aman out of trouble).
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>5. Security:</strong>
                    Reasonable measures are taken to keep your data safe. That said, no system is 100% secure — not even Aman’s Git
