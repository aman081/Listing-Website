            <h3>Terms and Conditions</h3>

            <p>Welcome to this website — a proud output of caffeine, code, and chaos, brought to you by Aman, a Computer Science undergrad who's definitely not procrastinating by perfecting this project. By using this website, you agree to the following Terms and Conditions. Please read them — or at least pretend you did, like the rest of us.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>1. Acceptance of Terms:</strong>
                    By accessing or using this site, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these terms. If you haven’t — well, your browser still loaded the site, so that’s consent enough.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>2. User Responsibilities:</strong>
                    If you create an account, you're responsible for keeping your login details safe. If your dog guesses your password and lists fake content, that’s on you. We assume you’re more careful than that. Probably.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>3. Intellectual Property:</strong>
                    All content, code, design, and any accidental genius on this website is either owned by Aman or used with permission. Copying anything without consent might result in a cease-and-desist... or worse, a passive-aggressive email.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>4. Limitation of Liability:</strong>
                    This is a student-built project — not a Silicon Valley startup. If something breaks, glitches, or just refuses to work at 2 AM (like Aman did once during finals), we are not responsible for any inconvenience, emotional trauma, or existential crises it may cause.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>5. Modifications and Updates:</strong>
                    These terms may be updated occasionally — usually when Aman finds time between assignments and coding sprints. Keep checking back if you're the kind of person who reads Terms and Conditions for fun.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>6. Governing Law and Jurisdiction:</strong>
                    These terms are governed by the laws of India. Any disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in New Delhi — because we had to pick a place, and Delhi felt dramatic enough.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>If you have questions, feedback, or just want to tell Aman he should’ve used a dark mode toggle — feel free to reach out. Otherwise, thanks for visiting, and please don’t break anything.</p>
